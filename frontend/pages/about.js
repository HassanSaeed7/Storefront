        CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a naturally occurring compound found in cannabis plants and emerging as a popular supplement. Unlike THC (the “other cannabinoid”), CBD oil is non-psychoactive and has a wide variety of everyday applications for potential health benefits. Thanks to our naturally present endocannabinoid system (ECS), everyday wellness is a real possibility.

What’s this? The ECS is a bodily structure found in all mammals (yep, even Fido has one) that is responsible for a wide range bodily functions; think everyday balance, system efficiency, equilibrium, stability, and overall wellness. CBD is good news for people looking for ways to feel more balanced without the unwanted side effects of THC.

How CBD oil is made gives you the potential benefits without the high, one of the many reasons for CBD’s increasing popularity. Not to mention, the on-going concern of if CBD is legal has been addressed through the 2018 Farm Bill, otherwise known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. This legislation changed the definition of marijuana to exclude hemp, therefore granting hemp plants and CBD preparations to be declassified as a controlled substance. The passing of this allowed CBD products from hemp to become more readily available, popping up everywhere for sale – from online shops to local retail stores.
